Overall, I feel like I met a majority, if not all of the requirements of the project.
There were alot of challenges for project1 thats allowed me to get more experience
with stylesheets and html documents. Though I would have liked for the website to contain
more color, when I asked the person the website was for they told me that they'd prefer
white/grey as the only colors on the portfolio. One of the biggest challenges was the sizing
of the pictures within the two galleries, some of them were weird proportions are a little 
bit stretched and I had no solution besides removing some content from the portfolio. The
resizing for smaller screens flows relatively well from page to page, though I should
have used firefox developer tools to make it a bit more dynamic in the changes with
correct area sizing for the page. The animation on the contact page does feel a little out of place, 
but I don't think it is too jarring in relation to the other page elements.
