1. What did you like about this website?
    * I think the style of the website matches very well with the theme of the content. The content is art focused, so having a minimalist website to better showcase the artists work creates a really interesting experience. I also like the look of the gallery view because it looks like an actual gallery. The animation is also quite nice. 

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's.
    * I think that the user experience on this website is a little better than my own for the most part. The experience is very aligned with the content. It's very simple, and that fits well with the simplicity of the featured art. I think that the styling on text could be improved. It looks a little bland at the moment.

3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
    * The code is very well organized and compartmentalized in a way where making changes would be simple. When writing the code for my website, I certainly over complicated it in multiple places, so I definitely learned a thing or two about how to make more overlapping style sheets.

4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    * The code is very well organized and compartmentalized in a way where making changes would be simple. When writing the code for my website, I certainly over complicated it in multiple places, so I definitely learned a thing or two about how to make more overlapping style sheets. Having a main style sheet for all of the shared elements is a much better approach than copying and pasting the same CSS code in multiple files. 

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    * I think that you could add some more content in a few places. I like the reactiveness of the page when viewing on mobile or a smaller browser window; however, on the main page the logo gets distorted and on the about me page the words get very small.
