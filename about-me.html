                    Pierce is currently a junior at JMU with a major in Architectural Design.
                    With his strong passion for architecture, Pierce loves taking studio classes
                    and studying unique architectural designs in his free time. Due to his strong drive,
                    Pierce enjoyed a prestigous internship at Caste Stone Systems as a draftsman. during
                    the time spent at his internship, he was responsible for designing concrete sills and caps
                    for buildings and exterior walls. These  sills and caps were designed using Pierce's deep
                    knowledge of autoCAD and other related design and modeling software.

                    As a architecture major at JMU, Pierce Parker has developed skills
                    with AutoCAD, the Adove Suite, Sketchup, and ArcGIS; along with, the many caveats of these programs.
                     Pierce has also developed his apptitude for working in a team during his
                     many internships along with the vital skill of time management. Pierce 
                     brings a positive hue to any project that he is partaking in due to his love
                     to learn rather than give up. Being a perfectionist, when Pierce is tasked
                     with anything, mistakes annoy him as he looks for the best possible solution
                     or aesthetic.
